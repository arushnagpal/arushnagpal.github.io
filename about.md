Hi there!! Glad to see you look at the about section.

I have been working as a software enginner in Walmart Labs since January 2017. <br /> I graduated from Thapar University with bachelors in Computer Engineering.<br />  I am passionate about computer science and in this blog I try to jot down some concepts which I find amazing or I didn't find them on the internet.
